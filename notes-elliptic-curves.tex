\begin{proposition*}
  Let $G$ be a topological group and $X$ a topological space. $G$ acts
  continously on $X$. Suppose $G$ and $X$ are locally compact. Then
  the following statements are equivalent.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The action is proper.
  \item For all $x,y\in X$ there exist neighborhood $U$ of $x$ and $V$
    of $y$ such that
  \end{enumerate}

Quotient map is not always a homeomorphism. Consider a topological
space $X$ and quotient space $X/{\sim}$. Let $V\subseteq X$ and let
$U=\pi(V)$. Even if $V$ is open, connected and $\pi\colon V\to U$ is
one-to-one, $\pi|_V$ may not be a homeomorphism. An example is
$X=[0,1]$ with equivalence relation $0\sim 1$, then $X/{\sim}$ is a
circle. Let $V=[0,1)$, open and connected. Further it's easily seen
that $U=\pi(V)=X/{\sim}$ and $\pi\colon V\to U$ is one-to-one. But the
image $\pi\left(\left[0,\frac{1}{2}\right)\right)$ of the open set
$\left[0,\frac{1}{2}\right)$ in $V$ is not open in $U$, impling
$\pi|_V$ is not a homeomorphism.
